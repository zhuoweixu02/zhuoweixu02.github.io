Hello! I am Zhuowei Xu, a second-year master student at School of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. [Zeynep Temel](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zeynep-temel/) and Prof. [Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/). My research focuses on developing **multi-modal tactile sensors** and using them to give robots a **structured understanding of contact**, thereby enhancing **dexterous manipulation**.

I received my B.S. in School of Mechacnical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024, where I was fotunate to work with Prof. [Genliang Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ggFP0yIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on **peumatic grippers**. This experience sparked my interest in manipulation and taught me to approach robotic-hand design from a bio-inspired viewpoint, using integrated mechanical design and control co-optimization to achieve better manipulation performance.
